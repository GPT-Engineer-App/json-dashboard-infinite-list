# json-dashboard-infinite-list

I have a JSON array of this format

```
[
  {
    "alt_text": "",
    "gen_caption": "",
    "generated_caption": "",
    "id": "",
    "keywords": "",
    "media_id": "",
    "preview_thumbnail_path": "",
    "provider_preview_link": "",
    "provider_thumbnail_link": "",
    "type": "",
  },
  {
    "alt_text": "",
    "gen_caption": "",
    "generated_caption": "",
    "id": "",
    "keywords": "",
    "media_id": "",
    "preview_thumbnail_path": "",
    "provider_preview_link": "",
    "provider_thumbnail_link": "",
    "type": "",
  }
]
```

I want to create a dashboard by reading this JSON and It should be a infinite list and when I select a list item, I should be able to see the caption, generated_caption, gen_caption and alt_text. the item should be an image from preview_thumbnail_path
